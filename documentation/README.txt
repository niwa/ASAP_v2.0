Please refer to the brukerpy_guide_v2.pdf for full instructions,
this is just a quick note about the repository.

I've included our example task, schedule and xpm directories with files
so that you can get started straight away, but you will need to adapt them 
to your needs. They are a starting point only. 

I've also included wheel files for the main dependencies in the requirements folder,
both for 32 and 64 bit, this might save you time but you should probably get the most up
to date versions.

Feel free to contact me on the above email

Happy Brukering!

Alex
